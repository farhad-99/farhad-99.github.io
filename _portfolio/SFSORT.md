First, fine tuning YOLO for CCTV videos in order to have a more accurate detection of peoplepresence in videos.

Second, developing the trackerâ€™s accuracy and speed using aspect-ratioand box-size joint distribution. 

Third, using the developed tracker for video synopsis.

A real-time accurate multi-object tracking system that operates with minimal computational overhead. The proposed tracking-by-detection method follows the online real-time tracking approach established in prior literature. Introducing a novel cost function called the Bounding Box Similarity Index, our job reduces the dependency on the Kalman Filter, resulting in decreased computational requirements

The results will soon be published as a paper(Expected in early January)
